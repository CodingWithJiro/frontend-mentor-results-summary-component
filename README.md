A clean, accessible, and visually engaging test results component designed using HTML and CSS. The layout adapts beautifully across screen sizes and supports dark mode.

Created as part of the building challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## üîç Overview

This project replicates a summary results card for test scores using a mobile-first, responsive layout. The left section presents a performance score with a gradient background, while the right side lists category-based results. The design is built from a static image and matched closely using tools like [PerfectPixel](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi).

Accessibility was prioritized through ARIA labels, semantic HTML5 structure, skip links, and light/dark theme compatibility via the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. Transitions respect reduced motion settings to ensure inclusivity.
